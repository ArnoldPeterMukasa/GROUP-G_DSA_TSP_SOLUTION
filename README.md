# GROUP-G_DSA_TSP_SOLUTION
This repository showcases our groupâ€™s implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as part of the CSC 1204: Data Structures and Algorithms practical assignment at Makerere University. Our work involves solving TSP using both classical and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) approaches and comparing their performance.
